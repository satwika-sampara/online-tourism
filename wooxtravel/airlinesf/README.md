# FlightReservation
Hello,
This is our "Flight Reservation Static Webpage" project in HTML, CSS, and JS.<br>
Firstly, I just wanted to thank our CSE326 Faculty Shabnam Ma'am for all of her help and guidance throughout this project. Her patience and guidance have greatly facilitated our development and learning.<br>
We mean group of three :<br>
Anmol Raj<br>
Vikramaditya Kehar<br>
Arpit Garg <br>
Made this project with 11 Pages <br>
Tour:the landing page having same name name css and in that page you will get all pages link <br>
kindly open pge "tour" page to experience all item of our project - https://anmolrk.github.io/FlightReservation/Flight%20res/tour.html<br>
Here we use jquery for validation for form in one page as we are three people made the program someone made with jquery and someone without jquery as I took the resopsibilty of all of the project as leader<br>
that's why i added all pages with jquery and without it, that is why some form validate and some not.<br>
thank you
